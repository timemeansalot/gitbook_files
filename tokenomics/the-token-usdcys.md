# The Token - $CYS

CYS is the native token that powers the Cysic Network, a vertically integrated ecosystem uniting verifiable compute, decentralized hardware, and AI/ZK applications. It serves as both the fuel for network activity and the unit of value for contributors who supply compute, secure the blockchain, or participate in governance.

Alongside it, CGT (Cysic Governance Token) functions as a non-transferable governance and reputation credit, designed to represent long-term contribution and ensure that governance power accrues to real participants rather than speculators.

#### 1. Core Utilities of CYS

*   Network Gas & Settlement:

    CYS is used to pay for proof submissions, compute verifications, and task settlements across Cysic’s execution environments.
*   Compute Reward Token:

    Contributors — such as GPU provers, ZK hardware operators, or Dogecoin miners — earn CYS through the Proof-of-Compute Contribution (PoCC) system, which measures verifiable on-chain compute.
*   Staking & Security:

    Validators stake CYS to secure the chain and receive protocol rewards.

    Compute nodes can also stake CYS to increase their reputation and priority for workloads.
*   ComputeFi Collateral:

    CYS serves as the base asset for compute-backed NFTs, node bonds, and future AI/DePIN leasing markets within the Cysic ecosystem.

#### 2. CGT — Cysic Governance Token

*   Non-Transferable Governance Credit:

    CGT cannot be traded or sold; it’s earned through verifiable participation (running hardware, proving tasks, or staking CYS).
*   Governance & Voting Power:

    CGT determines voting weight in the Cysic DAO, ensuring decision-making remains in the hands of active contributors.
*   Reputation Multiplier:

    High-CGT participants receive elevated trust scores and may gain boosted CYS emission rates or privileged access to new compute programs.
*   Long-Term Alignment:

    Since CGT accumulates only through real work and time, it anchors governance to those who help build and secure the network.



CYS represents economic value. CGT represents governance legitimacy. Together, they form Cysic’s dual-token model, combining monetary incentive with contribution-based reputation.

#### 3. Value Alignment

Cysic’s economy links verifiable compute with verifiable governance. CYS flows through the network as economic fuel, paying for, rewarding, and settling compute, while CGT grows as an immutable record of contribution and trust. This ensures that governance power and financial value both stem from real, measurable work.

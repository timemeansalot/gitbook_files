# Roadmap

Cysicâ€™s roadmap charts the evolution from specialized hardware infrastructure to a fully decentralized compute economy, where real-world machines, cryptographic proofs, and AI workloads converge on-chain. It is designed around one core mission: to make verifiable compute as universal and liquid as digital assets.

The roadmap shown the following three pictures, from foundational ZK hardware, to Cysic Network and portable miner, shows the team's commitment and contribution to bring mass adoption to ComputeFi.

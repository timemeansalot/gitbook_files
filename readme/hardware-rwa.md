# Hardware RWA

Cysicâ€™s Hardware RWA initiative bridges physical compute infrastructure for cryptocurrencies with on-chain financial representation, enabling real-world machines to function as digital assets. From portable edge devices to datacenter-grade mining rigs, every Cysic unit contributes measurable, verifiable compute to the network, and every unit is mirrored on-chain as a tradable or stakeable Compute RWA (Real-World Asset).

This model turns hardware into a yield-bearing, composable financial primitive within the broader ComputeFi economy. In the following, we list some development-in-progress products:

* DogeBox1 - Realize the Proof-of-Compute Contribution: Each DogeBox is a real, revenue-generating device, mining Dogecoin and earning $CYS by verifying ZK proofs generated by the ZK proof layer. Each is mapped to an on-chain identity for transparent reward tracking. It validates the feasibility of tokenized compute infrastructure, proving that everyday users can directly own, operate, and earn from physical hardware within the Cysic ecosystem.
*   Node NFTs - The Digital Compute Cubes: These NFTs grant holders a share of network yield, participation in governance, and priority access to new compute programs or AI/ZK workloads.

    By embedding yield and voting logic directly into the NFT contract, Cysic fuses hardware utility, governance rights, and tokenized returns into a single composable digital object.

Cysic Hardware RWA transforms compute capacity into a transparent, liquid, and yield-bearing asset class. It merges the physical and digital economies, where every device, from a DogeBox 1 on a desktop to future ZK-ASIC rack in a datacenter, contributes real work, earns measurable value, and exists as an on-chain financial instrument.

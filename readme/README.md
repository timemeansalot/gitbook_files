The versatility of ComputeFi allows it to support multiple industries and use cases simultaneously. Key applications include:

* **ZK Infrastructure**\
  Rollups and privacy-focused L1s require vast zkSNARK proving capacity. Instead of relying on closed prover-as-a-service models, they can outsource workloads to ComputeFi. The network delivers cryptographically verified results while distributing revenue back to providers.
* **AI Marketplaces**\
  Developers can deploy machine learning models and serve inference queries on-demand. Requesters pay per inference, while providers execute tasks and verifiers ensure correctness. This enables verifiable LLM outputs, pay-as-you-go inference services, and decentralized alternatives to centralized AI APIs.
* **Mining Integration**\
  Traditional hashpower is integrated as a form of compute liquidity. Bitcoin and Dogecoin miners participate in ComputeFi while continuing to secure their native networks. In parallel, mining rigs can be flexibly reallocated to secondary workloads, such as ZK or AI tasks, when profitable.

Through these applications, ComputeFi positions itself as the **general-purpose compute backbone** of the decentralized web.

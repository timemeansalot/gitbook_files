# ZK ASIC Products

Cysic’s ZK hardware product line provides the physical backbone of the verifiable compute layer, enabling zero-knowledge proofs and cryptographic computation at unprecedented speed and efficiency.

From embedded chips to datacenter-scale systems, the ZK hardware family, ZK C1 Chip, ZK-Air, and ZK-Pro, powers the next era of _Proof-of-Compute_ and _on-chain verifiability_.

#### 1. ZK Chip — Dedicated Proof Engine at the Silicon Level

* Purpose-built ASIC optimized for modular arithmetic, FFTs, MSMs, and field operations common in modern zkSNARK and zkSTARK systems.
* Achieves 10–100× higher efficiency than GPU-based provers by combining custom arithmetic pipelines with tightly coupled memory and streaming schedulers.
* Embeddable and programmable, allowing consumer or industrial devices to locally generate proofs — turning any edge device into a verifiable compute node.
* Forms the foundation for both ZK-Air and ZK-Pro platforms.

#### 2. ZK-Air — Portable Proof Device

* Compact, plug-and-play accelerator powered by the Cysic ZK Chip.
* Designed for developers, researchers, and early ComputeFi participants who need local proving power without datacenter complexity.
* Interfaces via USB-C or PCIe; supports major zkVM frameworks (RISC-Zero, SP1, Halo2, Plonky2).
* Runs the Cysic Worker to connect directly to the Cysic Gateway, earning CYS rewards for completed proof tasks.
* Typical use cases: lightweight ZK proving, AI model attestation, secure client-side verification, and testnet participation.

#### 3. ZK-Pro — Datacenter-Grade Proof Appliance

* Enterprise-class server system integrating multiple ZK Chips in parallel clusters.
* Designed for Layer-2 rollup operators, proof marketplaces, and AI-ZK verification services requiring sustained high throughput.
* Features multi-chip interconnects, PCIe Gen5 / CXL compatibility, and optimized firmware for batching large zkVM circuits.
* When registered as a Cysic Prover node, ZK-Pro contributes verifiable compute to the network and earns CYS emissions proportional to its throughput and uptime.
* Enables decentralized, high-performance proving-as-a-service within the ComputeFi economy.

#### 4. Unified Ecosystem

ZK Chip → ZK-Air → ZK-Pro form a vertically integrated stack — from silicon to cloud — that plugs directly into the Cysic Network. Together, they make zero-knowledge proving scalable, accessible, and economically composable, bridging hardware performance with on-chain incentives.



We expect to ship this line of product in 2026.

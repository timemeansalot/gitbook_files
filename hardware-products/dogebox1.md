# DogeBox1

Cysic DogeBox 1 is a next-generation portable Dogecoin + ComputeFi miner that bridges traditional proof-of-work mining with Cysic’s verifiable compute network.

It is the first consumer-grade node in the Cysic ecosystem capable of earning in both DOGE and CYS, turning home-grade hardware into a productive digital asset.

#### 1. Dual-Mode Mining

* DOGE Mining: ASIC-optimized cores deliver steady hashpower to the Dogecoin network.
* Proof-of-Compute Contribution: The same device simultaneously registers as a Cysic node, submitting verifiable compute proofs and earning native CYS emissions.

#### 2. ComputeFi-Native Rewards

* Every DogeBox 1 reports its verified hash performance to the Cysic chain.
* The network treats these proofs as compute contributions, rewarding them through the CYS Compute Emission schedule.
* Rewards follow a quarterly-decaying curve and a compute-related fairness function, encouraging early adoption but maintaining sustainability.

#### 3. Plug-and-Earn Simplicity

* One-button setup via Cysic App — connect to Wi-Fi or Ethernet, auto-register the node, and start earning.
* Real-time dashboard tracks DOGE mined, CYS earned, uptime, and device reputation (CGT credits).
* Supports over-the-air updates to join future ZK/AI compute pools.

#### 4. Designed for Sustainability

* Low-power, silent, desk-friendly device (around 50W typical).
* Lifetime participation in Cysic’s compute marketplace — after DOGE subsidies taper, DogeBox 1 can continue earning CYS from verifiable AI or ZK workloads.

#### 5. The Gateway to a New Compute Economy

DogeBox 1 turns meme-powered mining into mission-driven computing — where every hash not only secures Dogecoin but also fuels verifiable computation for the next generation of decentralized AI and ZK applications.

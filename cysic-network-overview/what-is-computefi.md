# What is ComputeFI

ComputeFi is Cysic's vision for a decentralized compute economy, transforming GPUs, ASIC miners, and servers into a programmable, verifiable, and liquid resource. Today, compute remains siloed and centralized, driving up costs for AI, zero-knowledge proofs, and mining. ComputeFi solves this by matching providers and requesters through a decentralized marketplace, where tasks are executed and verified via cryptography, redundancy, or consensus. With Cysic’s vertically integrated hardware stack, from custom ASICs to GPU clusters and portable miners, ComputeFi creates scalable, real-world compute liquidity, positioning compute as the missing pillar of Web3 infrastructure alongside DeFi, storage, and bandwidth.

ComputeFi is the financialization of compute resources. It turns raw computation into a programmable, tradable, and verifiable primitive, just as DeFi transformed idle capital into liquidity pools. In ComputeFi, compute cycles and hashrates are contributed by providers, requested by users, and verified by the network. The result is a unified marketplace where ZK proofs, AI inference, and mining workloads coexist.

ComputeFi is built on four foundational principles:

* Hardware-Agnostic: The network is open to GPUs, ASIC miners, CPUs, and specialized accelerators. No single hardware vendor dominates the protocol.
* Workload-Agnostic: ComputeFi supports multiple domains, from blockchain proving to AI to HPC. Modules define how each workload type is executed and verified.
* Verifiable: Correctness is enforced at the protocol level. Different workloads employ different mechanisms — zkSNARK validity for proofs, redundancy for AI inference, and hash verification for mining.
* Composable: Developers can integrate ComputeFi into dApps, protocols, or AI services via standardized APIs, treating compute as a first-class resource.

Cysic is uniquely positioned to realize this vision because it integrates silicon design, infrastructure, and blockchain coordination. Unlike software-only protocols, Cysic can onboard real hardware, from ASICs to portable miners, ensuring that ComputeFi is not just theoretical, but practical and scalable.

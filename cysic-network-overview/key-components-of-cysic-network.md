# Key Components of Cysic Network

Cysic integrates Compute Contributors, the Compute Client, the Cysic Network, and Hardware—matching ZK & AI compute demand with open supply, on‑chain.&#x20;

## Cysic Compute Contributors - Open Compute Supply Layer

Anyone can contribute compute (Prover/Verifier) for ZK & AI and earn CYS (Cysic Native Token) & CGT (Cysic Governance Token). &#x20;

The network supports a wide range of devices, enabling inclusive participation and scalable performance:

* Mobile Devices — Light verifier nodes operated through the Cysic Super App, allowing smartphones and tablets to contribute verification tasks seamlessly.
* Personal Computers (PCs) — Lightweight compute participation via desktop clients or Android applications, suitable for entry-level contributors.
* GPUs / CPUs — Professional-grade compute nodes for intensive ZK and AI workloads, accelerated by Cysic’s ZKPoG SDK, which delivers an average 22.8× performance gain through optimized proof pipelines.
* Mining Devices — DogeBox 1 home miner (55 W, 125 MH/s, < 35 dB noise), bridging DOGE → CYS incentives and expanding decentralized participation.
* ZK ASICs — The ZK Air (developer-grade portable) and ZK Pro (enterprise-grade) devices, both powered by Cysic’s proprietary C1 chip and Hypercube IR layer, deliver unmatched performance and energy efficiency for large-scale proving.

Together, these contributors form the backbone of the Cysic Compute Network, creating a decentralized, hardware-accelerated infrastructure that underpins verifiable computation for both ZK and AI applications.

## Cysic Compute Client - Compute demand Layer

Dev teams submit ZK/AI jobs, set budget/latency, and get verifiable results.&#x20;

Cysic serves ZK and AI projects with low-cost, verifiable compute:

* ZK Projects:\
  Cysic serves as a core Proofs-as-a-Service provider for the zero-knowledge ecosystem, powering proof generation and verification across multiple networks. The company has established partnerships with ETHProof, Succinct, Scroll, Aleo, Boundless, zkVerify, and other leading ZK projects, positioning itself as a foundational compute layer for verifiable blockchain infrastructure. As a core prover provider, Cysic has processed over ten million zero-knowledge proofs, demonstrating scalability and production readiness. Most compute contributors within the Cysic network supply resources to meet these real workloads, ensuring a continuous flow of verifiable computation demand. By combining optimized prover software, proprietary ZK ASIC hardware, and a usage-based economic model, Cysic delivers industry-leading cost efficiency and throughput, establishing itself as the backbone of the growing zero-knowledge proof economy.
* AI Projects:\
  Cysic is extending its ComputeFi network from zero-knowledge computation to AI inference and training, building an open marketplace for verifiable AI workloads. Through a unified task API, developers can submit jobs, set budget and latency parameters, and receive verified results. Workloads are routed to available GPUs or ASICs, with payments settled on-chain in CYS or Solana USDC. The marketplace will launch in late 2025 with serverless inference endpoints for models such as Llama 3-8B, QwQ-32B, and Phi-4, followed by training jobs that include budget and latency controls and can be listed on the Agent Marketplace for public use. Cysic has already validated this framework through its Agent Marketplace demo, where users deployed an AI suite for meme-coin launches (X Trends Agent, Logo Generator, Publisher Agent). This AI layer extends Cysic’s ComputeFi vision: linking compute providers, developers, and payment rails into a transparent, verifiable marketplace.
* Market-oriented compute demand:  In the future, Cysic will support high-performance, low-cost compute needs for small developers, startups, and individual users, driving broader adoption of ZK and AI technologies.

## Cysic Network - Ledger & Settlement Layer

Low‑latency EVM L1 recording tasks, proofs, payouts, and governance.&#x20;

The Cysic Network is the decentralized protocol that anchors all compute, verification, and payment activity across the ecosystem. Launched on September 24, 2025, it operates as a low-latency EVM Layer-1 built on Cosmos CDK, using a proprietary Proof-of-Compute (PoC) consensus mechanism that combines compute contribution with staking to achieve verifiable security and throughput.

As the ledger and settlement layer, the network records tasks, proofs, payouts, and governance actions directly on-chain, ensuring full transparency and auditability. Since launch, the Cysic Network has processed 13 million transactions for over 1.35 million users, supported by 118,300 Provers, 200,200 Verifiers, and more than 260,000 total nodes.

As a full EVM Layer-1, the blockchain supports on-chain swap, governance, CYS↔CGT conversion, and an integrated block explorer, forming the transparent, settlement-grade foundation of the Cysic compute economy.

## Cysic Hardware RWA - Edge computing & ZK ASIC

From portable edge devices to C1‑based ASICs—plug‑in capacity for the network.

Real-world tokenization of ASICs and Node NFTs.

* ZK ASICs: C1-powered devices as on-chain RWA for staking/trading.
* Node NFTs (Digital Compute Cubes): 29,000 total, representing yield, governance, and priority access.
* DogeBox 1: Home ASIC miner (10k+ preorders) showcased at Token2049, validating the production scalability of Compute RWA.

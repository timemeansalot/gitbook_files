# Dual Token Model and Governance

The goal of the Cysic Network is to establish a decentralized and reliable proving and verification service that fosters community growth and self-sustainability. The token will be used to incentivize provers, verifiers, and validators within the protocol, establishing an effective governance and reward distribution mechanism. Cysic Network uses a dual-token model, consisting of the network token and governance token. Each token plays a specific role in the network, working together to build the Cysic Network ecosystem:

* **$CYS**: The $CYS token is the native token of the Cysic Network and is used to pay transaction fees, block rewards, and other network-related activities. $CYS ensures the liveness and vitality of the network through its transaction fee mechanism and serves as one of the incentives for users to participate in network activities.
* **$CGT**: $CGT is the governance token and is non-transferable. It can be obtained by staking $CYS in a 1:1 conversion ratio. The un-staking process takes longer than the staking process, as implemented in the Cosmos SDK.

Compute providers contribute their computing power to the pool, which in turn provides services to ZK, AI and crypto mining projects. In addition to receiving block rewards from the Cysic Network, users can also buy $CYS and stake them to gain voting power to govern the computing pool. The distribution of computing power can be dynamically adjusted based on several key factors, with the external token rewards from different projects being one of the main factors.

The Cysic Network requires computing providers to reserve a certain amount of $CGT initially to defend against malicious behavior. All eligible providers can connect to the Cysic Network by staking $CYS as collateral to maintain the reliability and sustainability of the network service.

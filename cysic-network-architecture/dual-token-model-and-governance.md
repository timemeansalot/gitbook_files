# Dual Token Model and Governance

The goal of the Cysic Network is to establish a decentralized and reliable computing infrastructure  that fosters community growth and self-sustainability. The token will be used to incentivize computing providers, and validators within the protocol, establishing an effective governance and reward distribution mechanism. Cysic Network uses a dual-token model, consisting of the network token and governance token. Each token plays a specific role in the network, working together to build the Cysic Network ecosystem:

* **$CYS**: The $CYS token is the native token of the Cysic Network and is used to pay transaction fees, block rewards, and other network-related activities. $CYS ensures the liveness and vitality of the network through its transaction fee mechanism and serves as one of the incentives for users to participate in network activities.
* **$CGT**: $CGT is the governance token and is non-transferable. It can be obtained by staking $CYS and completing computation tasks. The un-staking process takes longer than the staking process, as implemented in the Cosmos SDK.

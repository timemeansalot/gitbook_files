# How to Stake

Staking your CGT tokens allows you to earn passive rewards while helping secure the network. This guide walks you through the entire process, from connecting your wallet to delegating your tokens to a validator.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the Keplr wallet browser extension installed. Keplr is currently the only supported wallet for staking CGT. If you don't have it yet, you can download it from the official Keplr website and set up your wallet.

## Connecting Your Keplr Wallet

To get started, visit [app.cysic.xyz/stake](https://app.cysic.xyz/stake) and click the **"Connect Keplr"** button. A prompt will appear asking you to approve the connection request. Once approved, your wallet address will be displayed on the interface, confirming a successful connection.

## Checking Your CGT Balance

After connecting your wallet, you'll be able to view your available CGT balance directly on the staking page. This shows the total amount of tokens you have available for staking. If your balance is zero or you'd like to acquire more CGT, head over to your Portal page where you can convert other assets into CGT.

## Choosing a Validator

The next step is selecting a validator to delegate your tokens to. The validator list displays key information including commission rates, voting power, and uptime. When choosing a validator, consider factors such as their track record, commission percentage, and overall contribution to the network. Diversifying your stake across multiple validators can also help reduce risk.

## Staking Your CGT

Once you've chosen a validator, click the "Stake" or "Delegate" button next to their name. Enter the amount of CGT you wish to stake, keeping in mind that you should leave a small amount unstaked to cover future transaction fees. Review the details and confirm the transaction in your Keplr wallet. After the transaction is processed, your tokens will be delegated and you'll start earning rewards.

## Earning Rewards

Staked CGT earns rewards based on the current APR (Annual Percentage Rate). Rewards accumulate over time and can be claimed at any point. Keep in mind that staking rewards are not automatically compounded, so you may want to periodically claim and restake your rewards to maximize your earnings.

## Getting More CGT

If you need to acquire CGT tokens, visit your Portal page and use the convert feature to swap other supported assets for CGT. Once the conversion is complete, the CGT will appear in your wallet and be ready for staking. &#x20;

## Unstake CGT

To unstake your CGT tokens, visit the Portal page and use the Unstake feature. The unstaking process takes 21 days to complete. After unstaking, CGT tokens can be converted into CYS tokens.&#x20;

Please note that only CGT tokens that were originally converted from CYS are eligible to be converted back to CYS. Any CGT tokens that were not converted from CYS cannot be converted back to CYS later.
